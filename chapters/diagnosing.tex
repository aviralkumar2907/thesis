% Q-learning methods are a common class of algorithms used in reinforcement learning (RL). However, their behavior with function approximation, especially with neural networks, is poorly understood theoretically and empirically. In this work, we aim to experimentally investigate potential issues in Q-learning, by means of a "unit testing" framework where we can utilize oracles to disentangle sources of error. 
% Specifically, we investigate questions related to function approximation, sampling error and nonstationarity, and where available, verify if trends found in oracle settings hold true with deep RL methods.
% We find that large neural network architectures have many benefits with regards to learning stability; offer several practical compensations for overfitting; and develop a novel sampling method based on explicitly compensating for function approximation error that yields fair improvement on high-dimensional continuous control domains.

In this chapter, we aim to understand challenges in learning policie from offline data. To this end, we empirically study the behavior of a class of standard RL methods when training on a static, offline dataset. In principle, off-policy RL methods should be able to leverage experience collected from prior policies for sample-efficient learning. However, as we illustrate in this chapter, in practice, commonly used off-policy RL methods from Chapter~\ref{chapter:problem_statement} based on Q-learning and actor-critic are incredibly sensitive to \emph{both} the dataset distribution and quantity. Building on these insights from our empirical study, we identify two main challenges in the offline setting: \emph{distributional shift} and \emph{sampling error}. In the subsequent chapters, we develop techniques to handle distributional shift (Chapters~\ref{chapter:bear}, \ref{chapter:cql}) and briefly, sampling error (Chapter \ref{chapter:scaling}), progressing towards reliable and easy-to-use offline RL methods.
