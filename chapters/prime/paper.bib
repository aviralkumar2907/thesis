train generative models. In this work we introduce the conditional version of
generative adversarial nets, which can be constructed by simply feeding the
data, y, we wish to condition on to both the generator and discriminator. We
show that this model can generate MNIST digits conditioned on class labels. We
also illustrate how this model could be used to learn a multi-modal model, and
provide preliminary examples of an application to image tagging in which we
demonstrate how this approach can generate descriptive tags which are not part
of training labels.},

@misc{kingma2013autoencoding,
  abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic
models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable
posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic
variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and,
under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable
case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization
of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be
straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second,
we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per
datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an
approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the
intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical
advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

  abstract = 	 {The recently-developed WaveNet architecture is the current state of the art in realistic speech synthesis, consistently rated as more natural sounding for many different languages than any previous system. However, because WaveNet relies on sequential generation of one audio sample at a time, it is poorly suited to today’s massively parallel computers, and therefore hard to deploy in a real-time production setting. This paper introduces Probability Density Distillation, a new method for training a parallel feed-forward network from a trained WaveNet with no significant difference in quality. The resulting system is capable of generating high-fidelity speech samples at more than 20 times faster than real-time, a 1000x speed up relative to the original WaveNet, and capable of serving multiple English and Japanese voices in a production setting.}

The statistical model gives reasonable out-of-sample predictions: ±9.5 K based on root-mean-squared-error. Features extracted based on thermal conductivity, atomic radius, valence, electron affinity, and atomic mass contribute the most to the model’s predictive accuracy. It is crucial to note that our model does not predict whether a material is a superconductor or not; it only gives predictions for superconductors."

pages={951-984},
abstract={We attempt to establish geometrical methods for amino acid sequences. To measure the similarities of these sequences, a kernel on strings is defined using only the sequence structure and a good amino acid substitution matrix (e.g. BLOSUM62). The kernel is used in learning machines to predict binding affinities of peptides to human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) molecules. On both fixed allele (Nielsen and Lund in BMC Bioinform. 10:296, 2009) and pan-allele (Nielsen et al. in Immunome Res. 6(1):9, 2010) benchmark databases, our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The kernel is also used to define a distance on an HLA-DR allele set based on which a clustering analysis precisely recovers the serotype classifications assigned by WHO (Holdsworth et al. in Tissue Antigens 73(2):95--170, 2009; Marsh et al. in Tissue Antigens 75(4):291--455, 2010). These results suggest that our kernel relates well the sequence structure of both peptides and HLA-DR molecules to their biological functions, and that it offers a simple, powerful and promising methodology to immunology and amino acid sequence studies.},
