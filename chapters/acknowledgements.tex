This dissertation is a product of the affection and guidance of a great many people who contributions to this perhaps outweigh any of mine. First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Jitendra Malik, for teaching me how to pursue impactful research, the numerous history lessons and having my back whenever I faltered. I wouldn't trade advisors for anything in this world. Thank you Alyosha Efros for (re)-introducing me to the treasure that is Berkeley and guiding me through testing times both as a mentor and an academic ``brother''. Thanks to my quals and thesis committee members Bruno Olshausen and Pieter Abbeel for valuable feedback on my research.

I have had the great fortune to be surrounded by some of the smartest and most empathetic people during my time at Berkeley. Thanks to my co-authors - Shubham Tulsiani who taught me great many things including the art of asking the right questions, Jo\~ao Carreira for his artful writing and Christian H\"ane for deepening my knowledge in 3D vision. Thanks to everyone in Malik and Efros groups: Saurabh, Bharath, Pablo, Jon Barron, Georgia, Pulkit, Panna, Ross, Deepak, Tinghui, Jun-Yan, Richard, Shiry, David, Evan, Judy and others, for all the discussions in the lab. My ideas and opinions have been greatly shaped by the discussions and I have learned immensely from them. I would also like to thank Angie Abbatecola for never letting the Berkeley bureaucracy bog me down and always being there to help.

My experience during grad school has been made ever so enjoyable by my amazing support group of friends. Thank you Sakshi, Somil, Tejas, Mobin, Smeet and Shiva for being there when the going got tough. Thanks to my group of friends away from home (Berkeley) - Partha, Sanjay and Pramit, for keeping me going. Thanks Varsha for always believing in me and helping me become a better human being over these years. Finally, I would like to thank the three most important people in my life: my father, mother and brother (Amlan). Thank you for giving me the freedom to pursue my dreams, teaching me the immense value of helping others and never letting me feel alone 8000 miles away.
