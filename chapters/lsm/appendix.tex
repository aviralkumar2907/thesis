\subsection{Detailed Results on ShapeNet}
We present per category voxel IoU numbers for V-LSMs (\tableref{vlsm_all}) and 3D-R2N2 w/pose (\tableref{r2n2_all}) for all 13 classes in ShapeNet. We also present per category results for the quantitative comparison between D-LSM and plane sweep stereo in \tableref{ps_lsm_all}.
