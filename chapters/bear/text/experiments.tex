\section{Experimental Evaluation of BEAR}
\label{sec:experiments}
\vspace{-0.2cm}

In our experiments, we study how BEAR performs when learning from static offline data on a variety of continuous control benchmark tasks. We evaluate our algorithm in three settings: when the dataset $\dataset$ is generated by \textbf{(1)} a completely random behavior policy, \textbf{(2)} a partially trained, medium scoring policy, and \textbf{(3)} an optimal policy. Condition \textbf{(2)} is of particular interest, as it captures many common use-cases in practice, such as learning from imperfect demonstration data (e.g., of the sort that are commonly available for autonomous driving~\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/GaoXLYLD18}), or reusing previously collected experience during off-policy RL. We compare our method to several prior methods: a baseline actor-critic algorithm (TD3), the BCQ  algorithm~\citep{fujimoto2018off}, which aims to address a similar problem, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bear_problem}, KL-control~\citep{jacques19way} (which solves a KL-penalized RL problem similarly to maximum entropy RL), a static version of DQfD~\citep{hester2018dqfd}, and a behavior cloning (BC) baseline, which simply imitates the data distribution. This serves to measure whether each method actually performs effective RL, or simply copies the data. We report the average evaluation return over 5 seeds of the policy given by the learned algorithm, in the form of a learning curve as a function of number of gradient steps taken by the algorithm. These samples are only collected for evaluation, and are not used for training.

\subsection{Performance on Medium-Quality Data}
\vspace{-0.2cm}

We first discuss the evaluation of condition with ``mediocre'' data \textbf{(2)}, as this condition resembles the settings where we expect training on offline data to be most useful. We collected one million transitions from a partially trained policy, so as to simulate imperfect demonstration data or data from a mediocre prior policy. In this scenario, we found that BEAR consistently outperforms BCQ~\cite{fujimoto2018off} and a na\"ive off-policy RL baseline (TD3) (by large margins), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mediocre}. This scenario is the most relevant from an application point of view, as access to optimal data may not be feasible, and random data might have inadequate exploration to efficient learn a good policy. We also evaluate the accuracy with which the learned Q-functions predict actual policy returns. These trends are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:q_vs_mc}. 
% Note that the performance of BCQ often tracks the performance of the BC baseline, suggesting that BCQ primarily imitates the data. 
Our KL-control baseline uses automatic temperature tuning~\citep{haarnoja2018sac}. We find that KL-control usually performs similar or worse to BC, whereas DQfD tends to diverge, and often exhibits a huge variance across different runs (for example, HalfCheetah-v2 environment).

\subsection{Performance on Random and Optimal Datasets}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
In Figure~\ref{fig:optimal_random}, we show the performance of each method when trained on data from a random policy (top) and a near-optimal policy (bottom). In both cases, our method BEAR achieves good results, consistently exceeding the average dataset return on random data, and matching the optimal policy return on optimal data. Na\"{i}ve RL also often does well on random data. For a random data policy, all actions are in-distribution, since they all have equal probability. This is consistent with our hypothesis that OOD actions are one of the main sources of error in off-policy learning on static datasets. The prior BCQ method~\cite{fujimoto2018off} performs well on optimal data but performs poorly on random data, where the constraint is too strict. These results show that BEAR is more robust to the dataset composition, and can learn consistently in a variety of settings. We find that KL-control and DQfD can be unstable in these settings.  
{Finally, in Figure \ref{fig:humanoid}, we  show that BEAR outperforms other considered prior methods in the challenging Humanoid-v2 environment as well, in two cases -- Medium-quality data and random data.}

\begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{chapters/bear/images/images_camera_ready/humanoid_mediocre_camera_ready.pdf}
       ~

      \caption{\label{fig:humanoid} \footnotesize Performance of BEAR, BCQ, Na\"ive RL and BC on medium-quality (left) and random (right) data in the Humanoid-v2 environment. Note that BEAR outperforms prior methods.}
\end{figure}

%With random data, BCQ is expected to not perform well, as it constrains actions to the actions seen in the dataset at a particular state. On the other hand, a na\"ive off-policy RL algorithm is expected to perform well in these settings. In Figure~\ref{fig:optimal_random}, we show that BEAR outperforms \cite{fujimoto2018off} drastically while still performing comparable to the na\"ive RL algorithm in HalfCheetah-v2, and Hopper-v2, and outperforming it on Walker2d-v2 and Ant-v2 tasks. On optimal data, as the suboptimality bias is small, the best solution is to imitate the behavior policy. BEAR learns to imitate the behavior policy, and maintains stably there. In this setting, na\"ive-RL algorithm fails to learn (and mostly converges to the minimum possible reward, that can be obtained in the environment). Overall, BEAR is robust to the dataset composition, and can consistently perform in all settings -- mediocre, random and optimal data. Figure~\ref{fig:optimal_random} summarizes the average evaluation return of the learned policy as a function of training steps.

% show that DQNs are empirically less stable than off-policy actor critic algorithms(TD3). In all cases, note that BCQ~\cite{fujimoto18addressing} often ends up imitating the baseline, which explains the reason for poor performance on random data, and fast convergence to optimal performance on optimal data. However, the versatility of BEAR demonstrates its use as a practical algorithm irrespective of the quality of the dataset $\dataset$. We also examine the amount of deviation from the true MC-returns of the actor and the learned estimate of the Q-value, which again suggests that BEAR can learn reliable estimates of Q-values without excessive overestimation as observed in TD3, while achieving better expected return performance over BCQ. \TODO{Q vs MC figure left}

\subsection{Analysis of BEAR}
\label{subsec:ablations}
In this section, we aim to analyze different components of our method via an ablation study. Our first ablation studies the support constraint discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bear}, which uses MMD to measure support. We replace it with a more standard KL-divergence distribution constraint, which measures similarity in density. 
% \TODO{how is this done if we don't have the behavior policy? do you assume access for this study? -- we train a behavior policy on the data and then constrain to that with KL or MMD (so it should be a fair comparison)}
Our hypothesis is that this should provide a more conservative constraint, since matching distributions is not necessary for matching support. KL-divergence performs well in some cases, such as with optimal data, but as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ablations}, it performs worse than MMD on medium-quality data. Even when KL-divergence is hand tuned fully, so as to prevent instability issues it still performs worse than a not-well tuned MMD constraint. We provide the results for this setting in the Appendix. We also vary the number of samples $n$ that are used to compute the MMD constraint. We find that smaller n ($\approx$ 4 or 5) gives better performance. Although the difference is not large, consistently better performance with 4 samples leans in favour of our hypothesis that an intermediate number of samples works well for support matching, and hence is less restrictive.

\fi
% Next, we study whether using a conservative Q-value estimate by subtracting the variance in the ensemble helps with learning. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ablations}, the conservative estimate 
%  makes a comparatively smaller difference than the use of MMD, providing some benefit on one task, while somewhat hurting performance on another.
% The ensemble produces more conservative estimates, which can result in underestimation in practice, and prevent overestimation divergence.

%The third factor in the ablation study is whether the usage of conservative estimates of Q-values subtracting the variance of the $Q$-ensemble helps. We find that on Hopper, usage of ensembles helps, whereas on Walker2d using ensembles hurts as the algorithm tends to underestimate Q-values. Figure~\ref{subfig:ensembles_ablation} demonstrates the average trend on 2 environments -- Hopper and Walker.
