\section{Out-of-Distribution Actions in Q-Learning}
\label{sec:bear_problem}
\vspace{-0.2cm}

% Q-learning and other ADP methods which rely on iterating the Bellman backup operator are particularly susceptible to out-of-distribution inputs, because any errors incurred on these inputs can be propagated to neighbor states via the backup and keep compounding over iterations of the algorithm. Unfortunately, error on a single state can propagate to other states and can potentially cause inaccurate predictions across the entire Q-function. As we will show, these inaccuracies do affect the performance of off-policy algorithms in practice.

I guess you're trying to show that the right plot has Bellman error (?), while the left has performance?

Building upon the discoveries presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter:diagnosing}, we have observed that Q-learning methods frequently struggle to learn from static, off-policy data, particularly in high-dimensional tasks. This difficulty is evident in Figure \ref{fig:divergence}. As outlined in the discussion of Chapter~\ref{chapter:diagnosing}, the primary cause of this instability lies in the challenges of handling distributional shift and statistical error. However, a crucial question remains: which factor plays a more significant role in this example? Furthermore, what mechanism underlies the emergence of this instability?

First of all, note that increasing the size of the static dataset does not rectify the problem (compare $n=1M$ vs $n=1000$), suggesting the issue in this setting is largely due to distributional shift. We can understand the source of this instability by examining the form of the Bellman backup. Although minimizing the mean squared Bellman error corresponds to a supervised regression problem, the targets for this regression are themselves derived from the current Q-function estimate. The targets are calculated by maximizing the learned $Q$-values with respect to the action at the next state. However, the $Q$-function estimator is only reliable on inputs from the same distribution as its training set. As a result, na\"{i}vely maximizing the value may evaluate the $\hat{Q}$ estimator on actions that lie far outside of the training distribution, resulting in pathological values that incur large error. We refer to these actions as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. 

Formally, let $\valerr_k(\bs, \mathbf{a}) = |Q_k(\bs, \mathbf{a}) - Q^*(\bs, \mathbf{a})|$ denote the total error at iteration $k$ of Q-learning, and let $\projerr_k(\bs, \mathbf{a}) = |Q_k(\bs, \mathbf{a}) - \mathcal{B} Q_{k-1}(\bs, \mathbf{a})|$ denote the current Bellman error. Then, we have \mbox{$\valerr_k(\bs, \mathbf{a}) \le \projerr_k(\bs, \mathbf{a}) + \gamma \max_{\mathbf{a}'} \expec_{\bs'}[\valerr_{k-1}(\bs', \mathbf{a}')]$}. In other words, errors from $(\bs', \mathbf{a}')$ are discounted, then accumulated with new errors $\projerr_k(\bs, \mathbf{a})$ from the current iteration. We expect $\projerr_k(\bs, \mathbf{a})$ to be high on OOD states and actions, as errors at these state-actions are never directly minimized while training.

To mitigate bootstrapping error, we can restrict the policy to ensure that it output actions that lie in the support of the training distribution. This is distinct from previous work~\citep{jaques2019way} which implicitly constrains the \emph{distribution} of the learned policy to be close to the behavior policy, similarly to behavioral cloning~\cite{Schaal99isimitation}.
While this is sufficient to ensure that actions lie in the training set with high probability, it is overly restrictive. For example, if the behavior policy is close to uniform, the learned policy will behave randomly, resulting in poor performance, even when the data is sufficient to learn a strong policy (see Figure~\ref{fig:gridworld}
for an illustration). {Formally, this means that a learned policy $\pi(\mathbf{a}| \bs)$ has positive density\textit{ only where} the density of the behaviour policy $\beta(\mathbf{a}|s)$ is more than a threshold (i.e., $\forall \mathbf{a}, \beta(\mathbf{a}|\bs) \leq \varepsilon \implies \pi(\mathbf{a}|\bs) = 0$), instead of a closeness constraint on the value of the density $\pi(\mathbf{a}|\bs)$ and $\beta(\mathbf{a}|\bs)$.}
Our analysis instead reveals a tradeoff between staying within the data distribution and finding a suboptimal solution when the constraint is too restrictive. Our analysis motivates us to restrict the support of the learned policy, but not the probabilities of the actions lying within the support. This avoids evaluating the Q-function estimator on OOD actions, but remains flexible in order to find a performant policy. Our proposed algorithm leverages this insight.

\section{Formal Analysis and Distribution-Constrained Backups}
\label{sec:dist_constrained}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
In this section, we define and analyze a backup operator that restricts the set of policies used in the maximization of the Q-function, and we derive performance bounds which depend on the restricted set. This provides motivation for constraining policy support to the data distribution, allowing us to address the issue discussed above. We begin with the definition of a distribution-constrained operator:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!6!white,colframe=black,boxsep=0pt,top=3pt,bottom=5pt]
\begin{definition}[Distribution-constrained operators]
Given a set of policies $\Pi$, the distribution-constrained backup operator is defined as:
%\[ \TPi Q(s, a) \coloneqq \expec \big[ R(s, a) + \gamma \expec_{\trans(s' | s, a)}\left[\max_{\pi \in \Pi} \expec_{\pi}[Q(s', a')] \right] \big] \]
\begin{align*}
\TPi Q(\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{a}) \defeq \expec \big[ R(\bs, \mathbf{a}) + \gamma \max_{\pi \in \Pi} \expec_{\trans(\bs' | \bs, \mathbf{a})}\left[V(\bs') \right] \big]
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
V(\bs) \defeq \max_{\pi \in \Pi} \expec_{\pi}[Q(\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{a})]\ \ .
\end{align*}
\end{definition}
\end{tcolorbox}
This backup operator satisfies properties of the standard Bellman backup, such as convergence to a fixed point, as discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:constrained_backup}. To analyze the (sub)optimality of performing this backup under approximation error, we first quantify two sources of error. The first is a \emph{suboptimality bias}. The optimal policy may lie outside the policy constraint set, and thus a suboptimal solution will be found. The second arises from distribution shift between the training distribution and the policies used for backups. This formalizes the notion of OOD actions. %and states.
To capture suboptimality in the final solution, we define a \emph{suboptimality constant}, which measures how far $\pi^*$ is from $\Pi$. 

\begin{definition}[Suboptimality constant]
The suboptimality constant is defined as:
\[ \alpha(\Pi) = \max_{\bs, \mathbf{a}} |\TPi Q^*(\bs, \mathbf{a}) - \backup Q^*(\bs, \mathbf{a})|. \]
\end{definition}
\vspace{-10pt}
Next, we define a concentrability coefficient~\citep{munos2005erroravi}, which quantifies how far the visitation distribution generated by policies from $\Pi$ is  from the training data distribution. This constant captures the degree to which states and actions are out of distribution.
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!6!white,colframe=black,boxsep=0pt,top=3pt,bottom=5pt]
\begin{assumption}[Concentrability]
Let $\rhoinit$ denote the initial state distribution, and $\mu(\bs, \mathbf{a})$ denote the distribution of the training data over $\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A}$, with marginal $\mu(\bs)$ over $\mathcal{S}$. Suppose there exist coefficients $c(k)$ such that for any $\pi_1, ... \pi_k \in \Pi$ and $s \in \mathcal{S}$:
\[
\rhoinit P^{\pi_1}P^{\pi_2}...P^{\pi_k}(s) \le c(k) \mu(\bs),
\]
where $P^{\pi_i}$ is the transition operator on states induced by $\pi_i$.
Then, define the concentrability coefficient $C(\Pi)$ as
\[
C(\Pi) \defeq (1-\gamma)^2\sum_{k=1}^\infty k\gamma^{k-1}c(k).
\] \label{assumption:conc} \end{assumption} 
\end{tcolorbox}
% \vspace{-10pt}
To provide some intuition for $C(\Pi)$, if $\mu$ was generated by a single policy $\pi$, and $\Pi = \{\pi\}$ was a singleton set, then we would have $C(\Pi)=1$, which is the smallest possible value. However, if $\Pi$ contained policies far from $\pi$, the value could be large, potentially infinite if the support of $\Pi$ is not contained in $\pi$. Now, we bound the performance of approximate distribution-constrained Q-iteration:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!6!white,colframe=black,boxsep=0pt,top=3pt,bottom=5pt]
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:avi_bound}
Suppose we run approximate distribution-constrained value iteration with a set constrained backup $\TPi$. Assume that $\delta(\bs,\mathbf{a}) \ge \max_k |Q_k(\bs, \mathbf{a}) - \TPi Q_{k-1}(\bs, \mathbf{a})|$ bounds the Bellman error. Then,
\[\lim_{k \to \infty} \expec_{\rhoinit}[|V^{\pi_k}(\bs) - V^*(\bs)|] \le
\frac{\gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2}\left[ C(\Pi)\expec_\mu[\max_{\pi \in \Pi} \expec_{\pi}[\projerr(\bs, \mathbf{a})]] + \frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma}\alpha(\Pi) \right]
\]
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{proof} See Appendix~\ref{app:error_prop}, Theorem~\ref{thm:avi_bound_proof} \end{proof}
This bound formalizes the tradeoff between keeping policies chosen during backups close to the data (captured by $C(\Pi)$) and keeping the set $\Pi$ large enough to capture well-performing policies (captured by $\alpha(\Pi)$). When we expand the set of policies $\Pi$, we are increasing $C(\Pi)$ but decreasing $\alpha(\Pi)$. An example of this tradeoff, and how a careful choice of $\Pi$ can yield superior results, is given in a tabular gridworld example in Fig.~\ref{fig:gridworld}, where we visualize errors accumulated during distribution-constrained Q-iteration for different choices of $\Pi$. 

Finally, we motivate the use of support sets to construct $\Pi$. We are interested in the case where $\Pi_\epsilon = \{ \pi ~|~ \pi( \mathbf{a} | \bs) = 0 \text{ whenever } \beta( \mathbf{a} | \bs) < \epsilon \}$, where $\beta$ is the behavior policy (i.e., $\Pi$ is the set of policies that have support in the probable regions of the behavior policy). Defining $\Pi_\epsilon$ in this way allows us to bound the concentrability coefficient:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!6!white,colframe=black,boxsep=0pt,top=3pt,bottom=5pt]
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:conc_coeff_bound}
% Assume the data distribution $\mu$ is generated by a policy $\beta$, such that $\mu(s,a) = d_\beta(s,a)$. Let $\mu_\beta(s)$ be the state-visitation marginal for $\beta$. Let us define $\Pi_\epsilon = \{ \pi ~|~ \pi( a | s) = 0 \text{ whenever } \beta( a | s) < \epsilon \}$. Let $\mu_{\Pi}(s)$ be the maximum discounted visitation marginal of a state generated by some sequence of policies $\{\pi_i\}_{i} \in \Pi$ and let $f(\epsilon) \defeq \min_{s \in \mathcal{S}, \mu_\Pi(s) > 0} [\mu(s)]$. Then, Assumption~\ref{assumption:conc} is satisfied for a $C(\Pieps)$ that is bounded as:
% \[
% C(\Pi_\epsilon) \leq C(\beta) \cdot \Big(1 + \frac{\gamma}{(1 - \gamma) f(\epsilon)} (1 - \epsilon)\Big)
% \]
Assume the data distribution $\mu$ is generated by a behavior policy $\beta$. %, such that $\mu(s,a) = d_\beta(s,a)$. 
Let $\mu(\bs)$ be the marginal state distribution under the data distribution. Define $\Pieps = \{ \pi ~|~ \pi( \mathbf{a} | \bs) = 0 \text{ whenever } \beta( \mathbf{a} | \bs) < \epsilon \}$ and let $\mu_\Pieps$ be the highest discounted marginal state distribution starting from the initial state distribution $\rho$ and following policies $\pi \in \Pieps$ at each time step thereafter. Then, there exists a concentrability coefficient $C(\Pieps)$ which is bounded:
\[
C(\Pi_\epsilon) \leq C(\beta) \cdot \Big(1 + \frac{\gamma}{(1 - \gamma) f(\epsilon)} (1 - \epsilon)\Big)
\]
where $f(\epsilon) \defeq \min_{\bs \in \mathcal{S}, \mu_\Pieps(\bs) > 0} [\mu(\bs)] > 0$.
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}
% \vspace{-10pt}
\begin{proof} See Appendix~\ref{app:error_prop}, Theorem~\ref{thm:conc_coeff_proof} \end{proof}
% \vspace{-10pt}
Qualitatively, $f(\epsilon)$ is the minimum discounted visitation marginal of a state under the behaviour policy if only actions which are more than $\epsilon$ likely are executed in the environment. Thus, using support sets gives us a single lever, $\epsilon$, which simultaneously trades off the value of $C(\Pi)$ and $\alpha(\Pi)$. Not only can we provide theoretical guarantees, we will see in our experiments (Sec.~\ref{sec:experiments}) that constructing $\Pi$ in this way provides a simple and effective method for implementing distribution-constrained algorithms. 

Intuitively, this means we can prevent an increase in overall error in the Q-estimate by selecting policies supported on the support of the training action distribution, which would ensure roughly bounded projection error $\delta_k(\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{a})$ while reducing the suboptimality bias, potentially by a large amount. Bounded error $\delta_k(\bs, \mathbf{a})$ on the support set of the training distribution is a reasonable assumption when using highly expressive function approximators, such as deep networks, especially if we are willing to reweight the transition set~\cite{Schaul2016PrioritizedER,fu2019diagnosing}. We further elaborate on this point in Appendix~\ref{app:bearql-more}.

    and constrained to the behavior policy (policy-evaluation, bottom). Triangles represent Q-values for actions that move in different directions. The task (left) is to reach the bottom-left corner (G) from the top-left (S), but the behaviour policy (visualized as arrows in the task image, support state-action pairs are shown in black on the support set image) travels to the bottom-right with a small amount of $\epsilon$-greedy exploration. Dark values indicate high error, and light values indicate low error. Standard backups propagate large errors from the low-support regions into the high-support regions, leading to high error. Policy evaluation reduces error propagation from low-support regions, but introduces significant suboptimality bias, as the data policy is not optimal. A carefully chosen distribution-constrained backup strikes a balance between these two extremes, by confining error propagation in the low-support region while introducing minimal suboptimality bias.}

% \subsection{Choosing Backup Policies for OOD Action Error Reduction}
% \label{sec:choosing_policies}
% Argument in Sec.~\ref{sec:tradeoff} tells us that, with a careful selection of the policy under which the target value is computed, the overall error of value estimates from the optimal value function $\|V^* - V_k\|$ can be reduced. How should we search for a policy that minimizes the overall error? Our choice is to backup from policies which maintain high-support over the action set of the data.
% %%SL.5.22: I think it's not obvious to readers that "policy for the backup" means the distribution over the actions under which the target value is calculated. -- addressed

% To justify this choice,
% %%SL.5.22: What choice? -- choice of backing up from any policy that maintains high support over data.
% we note that the error analysis relies on being able to quantify $\delta_k(s, a)$ (the per-state-action bellman error) for OOD actions. Outside of the support of the data distribution, it is hard to provide guarantees on $\delta_k$. However, when $a$ lies inside the support of the training distribution for a given state $s$, high-capacity function approximators trained with supervised learning are expected to produce a bounded error, given enough samples.
% %Even if they don't produce bounded error on such in-support inputs, techniques such as Prioritized Replay~\cite{Schaul2016PrioritizedER} can be employed to ensure bounded error on all in-support inputs. 
% %Furthermore, often the quantity of interest is the Bellman error weighted by the inverse density of the behaviour policy~\cite{antos07fitted}, which depends only on the support of the behaviour policy and this error metric is the equal for two policies provided they share the same support.
% Therefore, backing up from all actions that have non-negligible support under the training distribution is sufficient (but not necessary) to prevent error accumulation. Hence, we restrict the set $\Pi$
% %%SL.5.22: Did we define \Pi before? since we cut the set backup operator stuff, now this is much harder to follow. Maybe we can bring it back (but call it something else)?
% of policies used for distribution-constrained backups to the set of policies that are supported on the probable regions of the behaviour policy. That is, $\Pi = \{ \pi | \pi( a | s) = 0 \text{ whenever } \beta( a | s) < \epsilon \}$, where $\beta$ is the behavior policy (i.e., the set of policies that have support in the probable regions of the behavior policy). This means that we are allowed to backup from any action distribution supported over the support of the behaviour policy. Previous work~\cite{fujimoto2018off} restricts the choice of actions to be a distribution close to the behaviour policy. 

%%SL.5.22: I don't really understand what the above paragraph is saying. Read literally, it seems to say "prior work does something similar, and in the worst case we are equally bad." That's not very satisfying. Maybe just delete this paragraph, or rephrase if that's not what you meant?
%Now, explain why this does a good job of balancing the terms. Next, we explain how this bound motivates the use of set-constrained backups to reduce accumulation of bootstrapping error. \TODO{explanation about $\delta1$ goes here} -- addressed -- removed this paragraph

% Intuitively, we would like $\Pi(s)$ for a particular state $s$ to contain only those policies that permit actions within the support of the dataset distribution.

% %%SL.5.20: I don't really understand the above sentence. Try rewriting it to be clearer?
% Next, we move on to presenting our method, which we call \emph{bootstrap error accumulation reduction} (BEAR).

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\section{Bootstrapping Error Accumulation Reduction (BEAR)}
\label{sec:bear}
\vspace{-0.2cm}

% \vspace{-0.1in}
We now propose a practical actor-critic algorithm (built on the framework of TD3~\cite{fujimoto18addressing} or SAC~\cite{haarnoja2018sac}) that uses distribution-constrained backups to reduce accumulation of bootstrapping error. The key insight is that we can search for a policy with the same support as the training distribution, while preventing accidental error accumulation.
Our algorithm has two main components. Analogous to BCQ~\citep{fujimoto18addressing}, we use $K$ Q-functions and use the minimum Q-value for policy improvement, and design a constraint which will be used for searching over the set of policies $\Pieps$, which share the same support as the behavior policy. Both of these components will appear as modifications of the policy improvement step in actor-critic style algorithms. We also note that policy improvement can be performed with the mean of the K Q-functions, and we found that this scheme works as good in our experiments. 

% n components. Analogous to BBCQ~\citep{fujimoto2018off}, we use two Q-functions and linearly combine their predictions the Q-function for policy improvement, and design a constraint which will be used for searching over the set of policies $\Pieps$, which share the same support as the behaviour policy. Both of these components will appear as modifications of the policy improvement step in actor-critic style algorithms.

We denote the set of Q-functions as: $\hat{Q}_1, \cdots, \hat{Q}_K$.
% compute a conservative estimate of the Q-values: $\frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K \hat{Q}_i (s, a) - \lambda \sqrt{\operatorname{var}_k \hat{Q}_k(s, a)}$, where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is a hyperparameter. %We use this value as a conservative estimate of the Q-function. This can be derived using Cantelli's inequality. 
Then, the policy is updated to maximize the conservative estimate of the Q-values within $\Pieps$: 
% \vspace{-10pt}
$$ \pi_\phi(\bs) := \max_{\pi \in \Pieps} \expec_{a \sim \pi(\cdot|\bs)} \left[\min_{j=1,..,K} \hat{Q}_j(\bs, \mathbf{a})\right] $$
% \lambda \sqrt{ \operatorname{var_k}\expec_{a \sim \pi(\cdot |s) }[\hat{Q}_k(s, a)]}.$$
% \vspace{-5pt}
% Let $\mathcal{F}_t$ be the sigma-algebra generated by the training procedure until iteration $t$, and let $\operatorname{var}_{t} \hat{Q}(s,a) := \mathbb{E}[(\hat{Q}_t(s, a) - \mathbb{E}[(\hat{Q}_t(s, a) | \mathcal{F}_t))^2|\mathcal{F}_t]$
%%SL.5.20: use mbox. And for clarity, it might be good to indicate what the expectation is over (and use [ instead of ( for E so that parens don't get cluttered). Also, what is up with this (s,a) hanging out at the end? do you mean to put (s,a) inside (after \hat{Q})?
% denote the variance of the Q-function $\hat{Q}_t$, at time $t$ during training. Then, for each state-action pair $(s, a)$, 
% ${Pr (\hat{Q}_t \geq \mathbb{E}(\hat{Q}_t|\mathcal{F}_t) + \sqrt{\frac{(1 - \delta) \operatorname{var}_{t} \hat{Q}_t }{\delta}})  \leq \delta}$
%%SL.5.20: can you state in words what this means for the purpose of this section? also, rhetoric-wise, amybe better state as a theorem (it's kind of obvious, but still) and then after say that this is easy to show via Cantelli's inequality or something?

%%SL.5.20: It's not clear what the concentration bound is actually used for.

 %In the above concentration bound, $\mathbb{E}(\hat{Q}_t|\mathcal{F}_t)$ refers to the true Q-value, which can be obtained given no stochasticity in the procedure.


%%SL.5.20: The logical thread here is broken. What are you doing with set divergence? State the issue first, then th e resolution, else it's hard for the reader to follow.
In practice, the behavior policy $\beta$ is unknown, so we need an approximate way to constrain $\pi$ to $\Pi$. We define a differentiable constraint that approximately constrains $\pi$ to $\Pi$, and then approximately solve the constrained optimization problem via dual gradient descent.  We use the sampled version of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)~\cite{gretton2012kernel}
%%SL.5.22: Alg names are not capitalized unless they contain proper nouns, put a space after the words and before open paren (I fixed it above, but this issue happens often, please take this comment into account) -- Thanks for pointing this out!
between the unknown behavior policy $\beta$ and the actor $\pi$ because it can be estimated based solely on samples from the distributions. Given samples $x_1, \cdots, x_n \sim P$ and $y_1, \cdots, y_m \sim Q$, the sampled MMD between $P$ and $Q$ is given by:\\
$$\operatorname{MMD}^2(\{x_1, \cdots, x_n\}, \{y_1, \cdots, y_m\}) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i, i'} k(x_i, x_{i'}) - \frac{2}{nm} \sum_{i, j} k(x_i, y_j) + \frac{1}{m^2} \sum_{j, j'} k(y_j, y_{j'}).
$$
Here, $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ is any universal kernel. In our experiments, we find both Laplacian and Gaussian kernels work well.
%As the $\operatorname{MMD}$ distance does not depend on the density function of either distribution, minimizing it using samples is a reasonable proxy for enforcing that $Q$ lies inside the support of $P$. This is because, 
The expression for MMD does not involve the density of either distribution and it can be optimized directly through samples. Empirically we find that, in the low-intermediate sample regime, the sampled MMD between $P$ and $Q$ is similar to the MMD between a uniform distribution over $P$'s support and $Q$, which makes MMD roughly suited for constraining distributions to a given support set. (See Appendix~\ref{app:mmd} for numerical simulations justifying this approach).

% and hence, we parameterize the set $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{D}}_{\varepsilon}(s)$ as a distribution $\pi_{set}(a|s)$ such that $\mathcal{A}(s) := \mathcal{A}^{\pi_{set}}_{\varepsilon}(s) := \{a \in \mathcal{A} | \pi_{set}(a|s) \geq \varepsilon \}$, in other words, $\mathcal{A}(s)$ is the high-confidence support set of the distribution $\pi_{set}$, and we train for a parametric $\pi_{set}$.
%%SL.5.20: I don't actually understand at this point what you are doing. Are you optimizing a neural net that denotes \pi_set? or something else?

% \paragraph{Deriving the update:} Let $\hat{Q}_k$ be the Q-function at the k-th step of the algorithm. Actor-critic Q-learning algorithms maintain a parameterized policy, $\pi_k$ that is updated towards the maximizing the Q-function.
% %-- $\pi_{k+1}(s) := \max_{\pi \in \Delta_{|S|}} E_{a \sim \pi(\cdot|s)} [\hat{Q}_{k}(s, a)]$. 
% In order to reduce the number of moving parts, we let the actor in this case serve both its regular function of maximizing the Q-function while also constraining the action distribution close to $\mathcal{A}^\dataset_\varepsilon$, which is the the task of $\pi_{set}$. We use the bound derived on Q-values to update the policy in the direction of maximizing a conservative estimate of the true Q-value -- $$ \pi_{k+1}(s) := \max_{\pi \in \Delta_{|S|}} E_{a \sim \pi(\cdot|s)} [\hat{Q}_{k}(s, a)] - \lambda \sqrt{ \operatorname{var_k}E_{a \sim \pi(\cdot |s) }[\hat{Q}_k(s, a)]}$$
% %TODO{may want to mention that this amounts to subtracting a constant times the std, which sounds reasonable}
% We still need to account for the problem of specifying support divergence. In order to enforce this constraint, we use a measure of support matching between the training distribution $\Pi$ and the policy $\pi(\cdot|s)$, which we choose to be a sampled version of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy(MMD) Distance between $\Pi$ and the actor $\pi$. Sampled MMD distance between two probability distributions $P$ and $Q$ is given by, $\operatorname{MMD}(P, Q)$, where $x_1, \cdots, x_n \sim P$ and $y_1, \cdots, y_m \sim Q$ is given by:\\
% $$\operatorname{MMD}^2(\{x_1, \cdots, x_n\}, \{y_1, \cdots, y_m\}) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i, i'} k(x_i, x_{i'}) - \frac{2}{nm} \sum_{i, j} k(x_i, y_j) + \frac{1}{m^2} \sum_{j, j'} k(y_j, y_{j'})
% $$
% When the number of samples $n$ is an intermediate number (4-10), the above sampled objective can also be approximately considered as a distance between a uniform distribution over the high confidence support set of the distribution $P$ and the distribution $Q$ -- therefore, if trained perfectly, $Q$ should have the same support as $P$. That is, $\operatorname{MMD}(P, Q)$ is a reasonable proxy for $\operatorname{MMD}(\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{A}_{\varepsilon}(P)), Q)$. 
% %\TODO{what does it mean MMD between a set and distribution}
% The expression for $\operatorname{MMD}$ does not use the density function of either distribution, thereby making it suited as an approximate way of support matching.

Putting together, the optimization problem in the policy improvement step is
% \vspace{-5pt}
\begin{multline}
    \label{eqn:policy_update}
   \pi_\phi := \max_{\pi \in \Delta_{|S|}} \expec_{\bs \sim \mathcal{D}} \expec_{\mathbf{a} \sim \pi(\cdot|\bs)} \left[\min_{j=1,..,K} \hat{Q}_j(\bs, \mathbf{a})\right] 
%   - \lambda \sqrt{ \operatorname{var_k}\expec_{a \sim \pi(\cdot |s) }[\hat{Q}_k(s, a)]}\\
   \text{~~s.t.~~} \mathbb{E}_{\bs \sim \mathcal{D}} [\operatorname{MMD}(\mathcal{D}(\bs), \pi(\cdot|\bs))] \leq \varepsilon \quad
\end{multline}
where $\varepsilon$ is an approximately chosen threshold. We choose a threshold of $\varepsilon=0.05$ in our experiments. The algorithm is summarized in Algorithm~\ref{algo:bear_ql}. 
% Step 5 of the algorithm performs a stochastic version of the distribution-constrained backup, where Dirac-delta policies $\delta_{a_i}, \cdots, \delta_{a_p},(~\forall~i, \delta_{a_i} \in \Pi)$ are sampled, an expectation of the target Q-value under these Dirac-delta policies is computed and then the maximum value across these policies is backed up as defined by the backup operator. We provide more explanation in Appendix \ref{app:bearql-more}.

\textbf{How does BEAR connect with distribution-constrained backups described in Section 4.1?} Step 5 of the algorithm restricts $\pi_\phi$ to lie in the support of $\beta$. This insight is formally justified in Theorems 4.1 \& 4.2 ($C(\Pi_\varepsilon)$ is bounded). Computing distribution-constrained backup exactly by maximizing over $\pi \in \Pi_\varepsilon$ is intractable in practice. As an approximation, we sample Dirac policies in the support of $\beta$ (Alg 1, Line 5) and perform empirical maximization to compute the backup. As the maximization is performed over a \textit{narrower} set of Dirac policies ($\{ \delta_{\mathbf{a}_i} \} \subseteq \Pi_\varepsilon$), the bound in the above Theorem still holds. Empirically, we show in Section~\ref{sec:experiments} that this approximation is sufficient to outperform previous methods. This connection is briefly discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:bear_dist_constrained}.
% $\operatorname{var}(\hat{Q}_k(s, a)) \approx \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} (\hat{Q}_{\theta_i, k}(s, a) - \bar{Q}_{\theta, k}(s, a))^2$, where $\bar{Q}_{\theta, k}(s, a) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \hat{Q}_{\theta_i, k}(s, a)$ is the sample mean of the ensemble. 

%AK.05.15: Note to Sergey: this is the actor-critic version, optional depends on results.
% Another variant of the above approach can be where this single policy improvement step can be decomposed into two decoupled steps -- (1) Learning a policy $\pi_{set}$, whose high-confidence set defines the support set $\mathcal{A}_{\varepsilon}(s)$ at a state $s$, by minimizing the sampling error in $\hat{Q}_k$ and accounting for the deviation from the dataset, and then, (2) Learning to maximize the expected Q-function $\hat{Q}_k$ on this set $\mathcal{A}_{\varepsilon}(s)$, in practice obtained by sampling from $\pi_{set}$. In practice, we found using Equation~\ref{eqn:policy_update} working better than the latter approach and hence, we stick to this formulation for our experiments. The overall algorithm is summarized in Algorithm~\ref{alg:q_learning}, and the actor-critic version is described in Algorithm~\ref{alg:actor_critic}.

In summary, the actor is updated towards maximizing the Q-function while still being constrained to remain in the valid search space defined by $\Pieps$. The Q-function uses actions sampled from the actor to then perform distribution-constrained Q-learning, over a reduced set of policies. {At test time, we sample $p$ actions from $\pi_\phi(\bs)$ and the Q-value maximizing action out of these is executed in the environment.}  %The maximization step in the actor-update empirically helps, but can be coupled with maximization in Step 5. Similar to \cite{fujimoto2018off} we use a soft-minimum to compute target values for updating Q-functions. 
Implementation and other details are present in Appendix \ref{app:bear_additional_details}.

% where normalization $\lambda{\mathcal{A}}$ is introduced for mathematical convenience. Then, each policy evaluation step can be written as:  

% If we solely backup from actions present in our dataset, there is no way the algorithm can perform better than the policy that collected the data. The capacity of Q-learning and other ADP algorithms to ``stitch'' together performant sub-trajectories is lost. Hence, our method does allow the agent to backup from actions that occur outside the dataset, while still being constrained to not go farther away from the support of $\mathcal{D}$. In principle, a measure of distance from a given dataset can only be obtained using Bayesian Approaches (?). In practice, we use the variance of the ensemble as a measure to approximately quantify closeness to the support set. Our overall approach is described in the next paragraph.




% Our problem setting does not allow any interaction with the environment, and only lets us use the dataset $\mathcal{D}$. Since we see a limited subset of state-action pairs from the environment, the expected estimate of the Q-function conditioned on all training history in our case, $\mathbb{E}(\hat{Q}|\mathcal{F}_t)$, is biased. \TODO{aviral: finish this argument} 

% We train an ensemble of $N$ parametric Q-functions, $Q_{\theta_1}, \cdots, Q_{\theta_N}$ by using bootstrap masks on the data points of the dataset $\mathcal{D}$. This is done to simulate epistemic variance. To make sure that the actions chosen for backing up Q-functions are valid, we learn a set selection policy, $\pi_{set}$ -- a policy that can provide high densities to actions that don't propagate errors.
