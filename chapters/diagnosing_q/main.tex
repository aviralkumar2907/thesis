% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered

\begin{abstract}
Q-learning methods are a common class of algorithms used in reinforcement learning (RL). However, their behavior with function approximation, especially with neural networks, is poorly understood theoretically and empirically. In this work, we aim to experimentally investigate potential issues in Q-learning, by means of a "unit testing" framework where we can utilize oracles to disentangle sources of error. 
Specifically, we investigate questions related to function approximation, sampling error and nonstationarity, and where available, verify if trends found in oracle settings hold true with deep RL methods.
We find that large neural network architectures have many benefits with regards to learning stability; offer several practical compensations for overfitting; and develop a novel sampling method based on explicitly compensating for function approximation error that yields fair improvement on high-dimensional continuous control domains.

%end of the paper. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers
%who gave useful comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas,

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019. Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
