\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:setup}
% Our experimental setup is centered around \emph{unit-testing}. We evaluate a spectrum of Q-learning algorithms, starting with exact dynamic programming and replacing exact components with practical approximations, until the algorithm resembles modern deep Q-learning methods. 
% %We then introduce a suite of tabular environments where oracle solutions can be computed, to aid in diagnosis, as well as testing in high-dimensional environments to verify our hypotheses.

Our goal is to understand various challenges in offline RL. While it is definitely possible to study these challenges in common benchmark tasks utilized in deep RL (e.g., OpenAI Gym environments), these tasks do not necessarily provide us with the ability to compute oracle solutions and isolate challenges individually. Therefore, we perform our study in a "unit-testing" setup, consisting of gridworld environments with varying difficulty levels, where it is possible to compute oracle solutions and control for different factors independently. We release this suite of tasks at: \url{https://github.com/justinjfu/diagnosing_qlearning}.

\subsection{Algorithms}
\label{sec:setup_algos}
We use three different Q-learning variants, each of which controls for a specific source of approximation error -- 
Exact-FQI, Sampling-FQI, and Replay-FQI. 
We use FQI as a basis for our controlled analysis, as it strongly resembles modern deep RL algorithms while allowing us to separately isolate target values, update rates, and the number of samples used for each iteration. We then confirm that the observed trends hold with several state-of-the-art deep RL methods (SAC~\citep{Haarnoja2017}, TD3~\citep{pmlr-v80-fujimoto18a}) on standard benchmark problems.
%Although FQI is not exactly identical to commonly used deep RL methods, such as DQN~\citep{Mnih2015}, DDPG~\citep{Lillicrap2015},TD3~\citep{pmlr-v80-fujimoto18a}, and SAC~\citep{Haarnoja2017}, it is structurally similar and, when the replay buffer for the commonly used methods becomes large, the difference becomes negligible, since the sampling distribution changes very little between target network updates. 
%However, FQI methods are much more amenable for controlled analysis, since we can separately isolate target values, update rates, and the number of samples used for each iteration. We therefore use variants of FQI as the basis for our analysis, but we also confirm that similar trends hold with more commonly used algorithms on standard benchmark problems.

\textbf{Exact-FQI} (Algorithm~\ref{alg:fqiexact}): Exact-FQI uses known dynamics and reward functions and computes the backup and projection on all state-action tuples, without sampling error. We use Exact-FQI to study convergence, distribution shift (by varying weighting distributions on transitions), and function approximation in the absence of sampling error. 
%Exact-FQI eliminates errors due to sampling states, and computing inexact, sampled backups.

\textbf{Sampled-FQI} (Algorithm~\ref{alg:fqisampled}): Sampled-FQI is a special case of Exact-FQI,
where the Bellman error is approximated with Monte-Carlo estimates from a sampling distribution $\mu$, and the Bellman backup is approximated with samples from the dynamics as $r(s,a) + \gamma \max_{a'}Q(s', a')$. We use Sampled-FQI to study effects of overfitting. Sampled-FQI incorporates errors arising from function approximation, sampling, and distribution shift.

\textbf{Replay-FQI} (Algorithm~\ref{alg:fqireplay}): Replay-FQI is a special case of Sampled-FQI that uses a \textit{replay buffer}~\citep{lin1992replay},
that saves past transition samples $(s, a, s', r)$, which are used for computing Bellman error. Replay-FQI strongle resembles DQN~\cite{Mnih2015}, but lacking the online updates that allow $\mu$ to change within an FQI iteration. 
With large replay buffers, we expect the difference between Replay-FQI and DQN to be minimal as $\mu$ changes slowly.

We additionally investigate the following choices of weighting distributions ($\mu$) for the Bellman error:
%When sampling the Bellman error, these can be implemented by sampling directly from the distribution, or via importance sampling.

\textbf{Unif$(s,a)$}: Uniform weights over state-action space. 
%This is the weighting distribution typically used by dynamic programming algorithms, such as FQI.

\textbf{$\pi(s,a)$}: The on-policy state-action marginal induced by $\pi$.

\textbf{$\pi^*(s,a)$}: The state-action marginal induced by $\pi^*$.

\textbf{Random$(s,a)$}: State-action marginal induced by executing uniformly random actions.

\textbf{Prioritized$(s,a)$}: Weights Bellman errors proportional to $|Q(s,a)-\backup Q(s,a)|$. This is similar to prioritized replay~\citep{Schaul2015} with $\beta=0$.

\textbf{Replay$(s,a)$} and \textbf{Replay10$(s,a)$}: Averaged state-action marginal of all policies (or the last 10) produced during training. This simulates sampling from a replay buffer.

For our study, we selected eight tabular domains, each with different qualitative attributes, including: gridworlds of varying sizes and observations, blind Cliffwalk~\citep{Schaul2015}, discretized Pendulum and Mountain Car based on OpenAI Gym~\citep{gym},
and a sparsely connected graph. We discuss each domain in detail below:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Gridworlds}. The Gridworld environment is an NxN grid with randomly placed walls. The reward is proportional to Manhattan distance to a goal state (1 at the goal, 0 at the initial position), and there is a 5\% chance the agent travels in a different direction than commanded. We vary two parameters: the size ($16 \times 16$ and $64 \times 64$), and the state representations. We use a one-hot representation, an (X, Y) coordinate tuple (represented as two one-hot vectors), and a random representation, a vector drawn from $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)^N$, where N is the width or height of the Gridworld. The random observation significantly increases the challenge of function approximation, as significant state aliasing occurs.

\item \textbf{Cliffwalk}: Cliffwalk is a toy example from \citet{Schaul2015}. It consists of a sequence of states, where each state has two allowed actions: advance to the next state or return to the initial state. A reward of 1.0 is obtained when the agent reaches the final state. Observations consist of vectors drawn from $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)^{16}$.

\item \textbf{InvertedPendulum and MountainCar}: InvertedPendulum and MountainCar are discretized versions of continuous control tasks found in OpenAI gym~\citep{gym}, and are based on problems from classical RL literature. In the InvertedPendulum task, an agent must swing up an pendulum and hold it in its upright position. The state consists of the angle and angular velocity of the pendulum. Maximum reward is given when the pendulum is upright. The observation consists of the $\sin$ and $\cos$ of the pendulum angle, and the angular velocity. In the MountainCar task, the agent must push a vehicle up a hill, but the hill is steep enough that the agent must gather momentum by swinging back and forth within a valley in order to reach the top. The state consists of the position and velocity of the vehicle.

\item \textbf{SparseGraph}: The SparseGraph environment is a 256-state graph with randomly drawn edges. Each state has two edges, each corresponding to an action. One state is chosen as the goal state, where the agent receives a reward of one.

\end{itemize}

\noindent In order to provide consistent metrics across domains, we normalize returns and errors involving Q-functions by the returns of the expert policy $\pi^*$ on each environment. 

% \subsection{Function Approximators}
% Throughout our experiments, we use 2-layer ReLU networks, denoted by a tuple $(N, N)$ where N represents the number of units in a layer. The ``Tabular'' architecture refers to the case when no function approximation is used. 

% \subsection{High-Dimensional Testing}

% In addition to diagnostic experiments on tabular domains, we also wish to see if the observed trends hold true on high-dimensional environments. Thus, we include experiments on continuous control tasks in the OpenAI Gym benchmark~\citep{gym} (HalfCheetah-v2, Hopper-v2, Ant-v2, Walker2d-v2). In continuous domains, computing the maximum over actions of the Q-value is difficult ($\max_a Q(s,a)$). A common choice in this case is to use an ``actor'' function to approximate $\arg\max_a Q(s,a)$~\cite{Lillicrap2015,pmlr-v80-fujimoto18a,Haarnoja18}. This approach resembles Replay-FQI, but using the actor network in place of the max.
