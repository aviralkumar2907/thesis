  \caption{Fully automatic reconstructions on detected instances (0.5 IoU with ground truth) using our models on rigid categories in PASCAL VOC. We show our instance segmentation input, the inferred shape overlaid on the image, a 2.5D depth map (after the bottom-up refinement stage), the mesh in the image viewpoint and two other views. It can be seen that our method produces plausible reconstructions which is a remarkable achievement given just a single image and noisy instance segmentations. Color encodes depth in the image coordinate frame (blue is closer). More results can be found at \url{https://goo.gl/MgVQzZ}.}
